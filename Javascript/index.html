        CURITIBA
      </blockquote>
    <p>
        A city in the south of Brazil. Where I grew up till I was 18 years old. It’s my physical home, the streets make me nostalgic and my house recharges me like no other place. My mom’s family settled there after being prossecuted in Syria. My grandfather (a doctor and poet) came from Altinopolis (in the state of São Paulo, to curitiba to study medicine, yet he also was a poet.

        The feeling of home
      </blockquote>
     <p>
      <mark> Comfort, happiness, enclosure</mark>: Music makes me feel like myself. It comes naturally to me and helps me comfort myself. It helps me make my creativity my home. 
        
    My family was always extremely expressive and performative. We were always singing and dancing and playing the guitar. <mark>That has influenced my own relationship with music and performing. I started my own band and have so much fun on stage. </mark> 
    “Our House” was our classic family song, we always sung it on car drives or on the Holidays. “Raio de Sol” was a song my mom always played in the guitar, she said she was taught how to play it in college, and she thinks one of her sisters friends wrote it

    <p>
        I was raised by my mom in 
Curitiba. My siblings are much older than me, so since 10 years old it was me and her.<mark> Many things remind me of my mom: her scent, her manurisms, and her food.</mark>
    </p>
    <p>
        Those are a couple of things that remind me of home.
